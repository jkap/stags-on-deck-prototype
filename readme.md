# Stags on Deck: A Stag Sumo Typing Game
Stags on Deck is a game being developed by [Josh Kaplan](http://blog.davidflash.com) and [Greer Lawson](http://flyawaydog.tumblr.com). It's written in Lua using [Love](http://love2d.org) because it's easy to use and sufficiently powerful.

To run Stags on Deck, download [Love](http://love2d.org) from its website and drag the git folder onto the Love executable.

Stags on Deck is in super-alpha prototype stage. We're still working on art and tweaking the gameplay, but it works well enough to play right now!
